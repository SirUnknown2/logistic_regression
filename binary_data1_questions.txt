Military pilots sometimes black out when their brains are deprived 
of oxygen due to G-forces during violent manoeuvres. A study produced similar symptoms 
by exposing volunteers' lower bodies to negative air pressure, likewise 
decreasing oxygen to the brain. The data record the ages of eight volunteers and 
whether they showed syncopal blackout-related signs (pallor, sweating, 
slow heartbeat, unconsciousness) during an 18 min period. 
Do a proper exploratory data analysis. Fit a model with justification.
Does resistance to blackout decrease with age?
