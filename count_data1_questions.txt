A study of the habitats of the noisy miner (a small but aggressive native Australian bird) 
counted the number of noisy miners y and the number of eucalypt trees x in two-hectare buloke
woodland transects. 

By looking at the plot of x vs y, can you make any conclusion? Please provide
the basis of the conclusion. 
Fit a model with proper justification, i.e., provide the reasons behind the
proposed model to the dataset. 
Dicuss how the fit is.
